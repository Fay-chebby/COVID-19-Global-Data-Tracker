# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker
COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
Project Description
The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a data analysis project that tracks global trends in the COVID-19 pandemic. This project leverages real-world data to analyze key metrics, including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries and over time. Through data cleaning, processing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), this tracker provides meaningful insights into the pandemic's global impact. The project culminates in a data report with interactive visualizations, offering a comprehensive overview of COVID-19's progression globally.

Objectives
Analyze and visualize global trends in COVID-19 data (cases, deaths, recoveries, vaccinations).

Clean and preprocess data from multiple sources to create a unified dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and anomalies.

Generate meaningful insights to understand the global situation and trends.

Visualize the data through various charts (e.g., line charts, bar charts, maps) for clear interpretation.

Summarize findings and document the process and results for presentation.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python: Programming language for data analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For data visualization (line charts, bar charts).

Seaborn: For enhanced visualizations (correlation heatmaps, bar plots).

Plotly: For interactive plots (choropleth maps).

Jupyter Notebook: For documenting code, visualizations, and insights in an interactive format.

Git: For version control.

GitHub: To host the project repository.

Insights and Reflections
Impact of Population Density: Higher population densities were associated with faster COVID-19 spread in countries like India and the USA.

Vaccination Rollout: Some countries like Israel and Chile displayed remarkable vaccination progress, while others faced challenges due to logistical reasons.

Data Quality: Data inconsistency across countries highlighted the challenges in obtaining accurate global data. Underreporting in certain regions, especially in Africa, may skew global comparisons.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize the COVID-19 pandemic's global trends through the use of Python data tools. By processing and analyzing real-world data, the project provides valuable insights into the pandemic's impact and vaccine distribution. The insights can help inform decision-making in healthcare and policy.
